  The pandemic made everyone crazy. I felt like I was going crazy before it though, and it felt like the rest of the world just went crazy with me. 
  
  <p>In my last year of undergrad, I was powering through. I had gotten all A's during the Zoom years. I had an Honors scholarship and a job at the library.
  I had "done research." I had signed a contract promising that I would go to graduate school in the fall. 
  I had doctors for what felt like the first time in years. I volunteered. I took the bus.
    
  <p>To make a long story short, I spent a week between December and January in the hospital with myocarditis. 
    I kept imagining myself as the Grinch from the end of the book when his heart grows two sizes too big. 
    When I first went to the emergency room with chest pain, the ER doctors assured me that it <i>seemed</i> like I was having a heart attack. 
    It took a few days for them to be certain that my heart was just too big, and that it was not in danger of stopping. 
    I didn't love spending my winter break plugged into wires and being poked with needles, but I did appreciate the vacation in the private suite with my own bathroom, and having the ultimate excuse to ignore emails.
    
    <p>The doctors couldn't really tell me why it happened, but it had something to do with the Covid booster shot I'd gotten the morning of the day I went to the ER, and possibly an interaction with the testosterone I'd been injecting. 
      I also suspect that it had to do with my overall bodily health--all nighters and energy drinks, inconsistent exercise, fast food, desk job, smoking, quitting smoking, vaping, drinking too much, getting beat up in mosh pits...
    <p>It didn't occur to me to ask for time off that semester, from classes or from my job. I eventually sought accomodations when I realized that--despite being told by the doctors to rest and avoid physical activity, I was still running to catch the bus every morning. I struggled with chest pain for the better part of the semester, and had visits to doctors and specialists every week. 
      
    <p>I got into grad schools, I passed my classes, I turned in late papers, I caught the bus, I went to the doctors, I went to concerts, I went to the Cinematheque, I sang karaoke, I had the worst acne of my life. 
      On graduation night, I did standup comedy at a talent show and passed out afterwards. I woke up in the hospital. I powered through.
